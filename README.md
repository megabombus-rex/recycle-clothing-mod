# Enchanced Prioritization Mod for RimWorld

Mod trying to redefine prioritization of tasks in Rimworld.

## Premise

I am not fully satisfied with Rimworld priorities system.
While the tasks in Rimworld that are done by my Pawns are in correct order type-wise, I want those tasks to also be done in correct order.

If you played Oxygen Not Included for example, there you could set priorities for the colonist (pawn) and also the task itself could have its own priority (1-10), so the colonists would do their work in correct order.
So it would be like this:
- a Pawn has its priorities set and it works as previously,
- at creation you could choose the priority for that task by selecting a value between 1-10,
- you can change the task priority after its creation by a special view that shows the priorities of all/selected tasks.
